üöÄ 21 Days, 21 Projects

This repository is a 21-day coding challenge where I built 21 projects in 21 days.
The goal was to strengthen my AI, ML, and Data Science skills by building practical, hands-on projects daily.

Each project is organized by Day1, Day2, Day3 ‚Ä¶ Day21, with code, documentation, and resources.
